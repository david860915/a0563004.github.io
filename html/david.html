                <p>When Duke Ellington was controversially denied a Pulitzer in 1965, he responded: “Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn’t want me to be too famous too young.” He was 67 at the time. Lamar is just 30, undaunted by fame, and more untouchable than any MC in the history of hip-hop. The Pulitzer is just the latest confirmation that he stands alone. </br>
